# NN_from_scratch

This repo contains a neural network made from scratch in line with the book "Neural networks from scratch with Python". Its main idea is to unveil the inner workings of a neural network, and be able to dive deep into the different aspects and calculations of a neural network.

Personally, my goal was to code a neural network from the ground up, and thus be able to gain some intuition and insight of what's going on behind the curtains. I hope some of this will prove as equally helpful for someone else starting their journey in machine learning.

As of 26/09/24, the main script lacks clear and friendly interface capabilities. While it works perfectly, work is still pending to provide an easy to use interface that allows users to perform tests.
